## Programming Practice

I believe programming practice is essential to SW development, so I sometimes use those platforms below for implementation skills.

1. [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) for my competitive programming experience, and recently joined **codeforces round #722 (May 25th, 2021)**, and have participated **1** competition(s) in total. My handle is [carrtesy](https://codeforces.com/profile/carrtesy).
2. [Baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/) is a Korean online judge platform for Programming Practice, and I've solved **200** problems and ranked **8072** until **May 19th, 2021**. Here is [my info](https://www.acmicpc.net/user/ehdals56).
3. [Programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/) is another Korean Programming Practice platform, and I've solved **131** programming & SQL problems and ranked **2353** until **May 19th, 2021**.
