Nice to meet you! I'm **Dongmin Kim (*Tommy*)** from Korea. I'm deeply interested in SW & Mathematical background behind it, and now trying to change the way people live with SW technology. I'm using this blog as my storage for my knowledges and technologies that I've been now working for. For more formal introduction of me, you may see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qg-GGGiDWKKaUqvxoGnjdjX_U3-1y6kS/view?usp=sharing) here.



# Programming Practice

I believe programming practice is essential to SW development, so I sometimes use those platforms below for implementation skills.

1. [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) for my competitive programming experience, and recently joined **codeforces round #722 (May 25th, 2021) **, and have participated **1** competition(s) in total.
2. [Baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/) is a Korean online judge platform for Programming Practice, and I've solved **200** problems and ranked **8072** until **May 19th, 2021**. Here is [my info](https://www.acmicpc.net/user/ehdals56).
3. [Programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/) is another Korean Programming Practice platform, and I've solved **131** programming & SQL problems and ranked **2353** until **May 19th, 2021**.



# Projects

Here are some lists of projects that I've worked.



## Crude Oil Price Prediction based on GKFN (Mar 2020 ~ Nov 2020)

**My very first thesis here on Modelling!**

For my Undergraduate Dissertation, I was fortunate to get advice from Prof. Rhee Man Kil and collaborate with [David Shin](https://github.com/davidshyn1). You may view our thesis(in Korean) [here](https://github.com/dongminkim0220/Oil-Price-Prediction-Project/blob/master/%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%B0%EC%8B%9C%EC%95%88%20%EC%BB%A4%EB%84%90%20%EB%84%A4%ED%8A%B8%EC%9B%8C%ED%81%AC%EB%A5%BC%20%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%9C%20%EC%9B%90%EC%9C%A0%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%EC%98%88%EC%B8%A1(%EC%84%B1%EA%B7%A0%EA%B4%80%EB%8C%80%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90%20%EA%B9%80%EB%8F%99%EB%AF%BC%2C%20%EC%8B%A0%EC%84%B1%EA%B5%AD).pdf), and also our github repo [here](https://github.com/dongminkim0220/Oil-Price-Prediction-Project).

## Tensor Decomposition for Deepfake Detection (July 2020 ~ Aug 2020)

**First moment with neural network project!**

For my Undergraduate Research Project, I've participated in [Prof. Simon Woo's DASH LAB](https://dash-lab.github.io/About/) Project, and did some researches on Tensor Decomposition for Deepfake Detection Project. You may visited my [github repo](https://github.com/dongminkim0220/Deepfake_with_tensor_decomposition) for my project, and see some ideas, and my own research procedure there.

## Pet-caring Robots

**I still remember the moment when my SW controlled my device!**

In SKKU embedded systems projects course, pet-caring robot was my team's topic. Our team implemented functions such as wheel control, bluetooth, web control through python django, and real-time communications. You may visit and watch our video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Zy1u3YFXNShyjKSyJK_40nSqBsFRG7h/view).
