### Crude Oil Price Prediction based on GKFN (Mar 2020 ~ Nov 2020)

*My very first thesis here on Modeling!*

For my Undergraduate Dissertation, I was fortunate to get advice from Prof. Rhee Man Kil and collaborate with [David Shin](https://github.com/davidshyn1). You may view our thesis(in Korean) [here](https://github.com/dongminkim0220/Oil-Price-Prediction-Project/blob/master/%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%B0%EC%8B%9C%EC%95%88%20%EC%BB%A4%EB%84%90%20%EB%84%A4%ED%8A%B8%EC%9B%8C%ED%81%AC%EB%A5%BC%20%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%9C%20%EC%9B%90%EC%9C%A0%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%EC%98%88%EC%B8%A1(%EC%84%B1%EA%B7%A0%EA%B4%80%EB%8C%80%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90%20%EA%B9%80%EB%8F%99%EB%AF%BC%2C%20%EC%8B%A0%EC%84%B1%EA%B5%AD).pdf), and also our github repo [here](https://github.com/dongminkim0220/Oil-Price-Prediction-Project).

### Tensor Decomposition for Deepfake Detection (July 2020 ~ Aug 2020)

*First moment with neural network project!*

For my Undergraduate Research Project, I've participated in [Prof. Simon Woo's DASH LAB](https://dash-lab.github.io/About/) Project, and did some researches on Tensor Decomposition for Deepfake Detection Project. You may visit my [github repo](https://github.com/dongminkim0220/Deepfake_with_tensor_decomposition) for my project, and see some ideas, and my own research procedure there.

### Pet-caring Robots

*I still remember the moment when my SW controlled my device!*

In SKKU embedded systems projects course, pet-caring robot was my team's topic. Our team implemented functions such as wheel control, bluetooth, web control through python django, and real-time communications. You may visit and watch our video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Zy1u3YFXNShyjKSyJK_40nSqBsFRG7h/view).

### GLIF Website Project

*End to End Programming Project: From coding to deploying!*

For the purpose of building communication channels for SKKU GLIFers, I tried building website for them. It was half-success and half-failure. I used **Python Django** Framework for SW, *[Iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/)* for domain service, and *[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)* for hosting. It is now out of service, but it was my unique experience of doing web programming for real-world problems. You may visit my repo [here](https://github.com/dongminkim0220/GLIF_Website_Project).
