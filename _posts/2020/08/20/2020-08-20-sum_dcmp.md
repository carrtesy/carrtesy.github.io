This problem is from: <https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2225>

### Problem Description
Write a program that counts the cases of :
Out of integer in range 0~N, sum of K Combination is N.

- If the order of addition is different, that corresponds to different case
(e.g. 1+2 and 2+1 are different).
- Each number can be used repeatedly.
- input range: 1  <= N <= 200, 1 <= K <= 200
- output: print out the remainder when divide the answer by 1,000,000,000

### Examples
input 1
```
20 2
```

output 1
```
21
```

### Idea

Let DP[N][K] represents the number of cases that makes N out of K numbers:
Then,  
$$
	 DP[N][K]  =  \sum_{i=0}^N (DP[N-i][K-1]) 
$$ 

In a plain words,
The number of cases that makes N out of K numbers (DP[N][K]) equals 
all summation of cases that leave out single component(say i), and makes N-i out of K-1 components.
 
### Solution

- get inputs, and setups

```cpp
int N, K;

cin >> N;
cin >> K;

// dp[N][K] : make N out of K numbers.
// setup 2D array

long long ** dp = new long long * [N+1];
for(int i = 0; i <= N; i++){
  dp[i] = new long long [K+1];
} 
```

By dynamic allocation, size of (N+1) x (K+1) 2D array is set.


- initialization

```cpp
// init
for(int i = 0; i <= N; i++){
  dp[i][1] = 1;
}

for(int k = 2; k <= K; k++){
  dp[0][k] = 0;
}
```

Here, we are setting up some trivial values.
First Iteration: If we pick just 1 number, we only have only one cases.
Second Iteration: If try to make 0 with more than 2 numbers, it is not possible.

- main logic

```cpp
// dp[N][K] = sigma(dp[N-i][K-1])
for(int k = 2; k <= K; k++){
  for(int n = 2; n <= N; n++){
    long long sum = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
      sum += dp[n-i][k-1];
    }
    dp[n][k] = sum % DIV;
  } 
}

cout << dp[N][K] <<endl;
```

Here we apply the logic mentioned in idea section.

- wrap up

```cpp
// delete
for(int i = 0; i <= N; i++){
  delete dp[i];
} 
```

Return the resources here.


### Complexity
Space: using length N+1 of array: O( N^2 )

Time: filling in the array above: O( N^3 )

Are there any better ways to do?
