# Monte Carlo Process to estimate ùúã with visualization

The task is to compute an approximation to $ \pi $ using [Monte Carlo][monte-carlo].

## Version 1
First we draw unit circle, which is $$ x^2 + y^2 = 1 $$ 
to the coordinate and plot the dots.

‚Äã```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initial Setting
# trial is the number of trial
# inCircle is the number of points in the circle
trial = 1000
inCircle = 0

# Draw circle with radius 1 : x^2 + y^2 = 1
circle = plt.Circle((0, 0), radius = 1, color='black', fill=False)
ax = plt.gca()
ax.add_artist(circle)

# Plot with uniform dist
for i in range(trial):
    x = np.random.uniform(-1,1)
    y = np.random.uniform(-1,1)
    
    if (x**2 + y**2 < 1):
        inCircle += 1
        plt.scatter(x, y, s = 1, color = "black")
    else:
        plt.scatter(x, y, s = 1, color = "blue")
            
# Show the canvas and calculate the answer
plt.axis([-1, 1, -1, 1])
plt.show()

ratio = inCircle/trial
œÄ = ratio * 4
print(œÄ)
‚Äã```

The result comes out as:
