The task is to devise a model representing [Cobweb Process][cobweb-process].

*Python* is used for representation.

***

### Modeling: 
Let's model the cobweb process into code.

**Version 1**: Draw unit circle to the coordinate and plot the dots.

Let's install additional package first: [pynverse][pynverse].

This package is used to get inverse function.

Why? 

In economic modeling, price *P*, the independent variable is usually located vertical axis, not horizontal axis.
 
{% highlight python %}
!pip install pynverse
{% endhighlight %}

Let's import the setups. 

{% highlight python %}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from pynverse import inversefunc # this package provides inverse function
{% endhighlight %}

Firstly, Let's define the function to plot market status, **plotMarket**.

{% highlight python %}
def plotMarket(D, S, Q_max, P_max):
	# ranges to plot    
	plt.xlim(left = 0)
	plt.xlim(right = Q_max)
	plt.ylim(bottom = 0)
	plt.ylim(top = P_max)
		
	# create list for prices.
	rangeP = np.linspace(0, P_max, P_max * 100)
    
	# plot Demand/Supply curves, using price range
	plt.plot(list(map(D, rangeP)), rangeP)
	plt.plot(list(map(S, rangeP)), rangeP)
{% endhighlight %}

In here, **plotMarket** gets 4 parameters
- D, S: functions(lambda) representing Demand and Supply Curve
- Q_max, P_max: representing maximum range of the coordinate

And also, let's setup a function which draws line between two points, **connectPoints**.

{% highlight python %}
def connectPoints(point1, point2):
    plt.plot([point1[0], point2[0]],[point1[1], point2[1]] , 'k-', linewidth = 1)
{% endhighlight %}

In here, **connectPoints** gets 2 parameters representing coordinates, by a list.

Next, let's devise a cobweb process. 

{% highlight python %}
def cobwebProcess(D, S, S_adj, init_price, ϵ, periods):
    P = init_price
    S_inv = inversefunc(S)
    
    for i in range(periods):
        S_cur = [S(P), P]
        D_cur = [D(P), P]
        connectPoints(S_cur, D_cur)
        # Supplier is adjusting Quantity, according to current demand
        Q = S_adjusting_function(D(P))
        P = S_inv(Q)    
        S_next = [Q, P]
        connectPoints(D_cur, S_next)
        
        # if market is near equilibrium, break.
        if(abs(D(P) - S(P)) < ϵ):
            print("Market is in equilibrium.\n",\
                  "Iteration: ", i+1, "\n",\
                  "-Supply side\n",\
                  "P: ", P, "\n",\
                  "Q: ", S(P), "\n", \
                  "-Demand side\n",\
                  "P: ", P, "\n",\
                  "Q: ", D(P), "\n", \
                 )
            break
        
        # if market was not able to reach equilibrium, report.
        if((i == periods - 1) and (abs(D(P) - S(P)) >= ϵ)):
            print("Economy wasn't able to reach equilibrium.\n",\
                  "-Supply side\n",\
                  "P: ", P, "\n",\
                  "Q: ", S(P), "\n", \
                  "-Demand side\n",\
                  "P: ", P, "\n",\
                  "Q: ", D(P), "\n", \
                 )
{% endhighlight %}

In here, **plotMarket** gets 6 parameters
- D, S: functions(lambda) representing Demand and Supply Curve
- S_adj: functions(lambda) representing suppliers' adjusting behavior. How would suppliers' react to unexpected, wrong "quantity demanded"?
- init_price: as it's name suggests!
- ϵ: epsilon, which meant to be admissible error. If we can get the situation of S(Q) = S(D), it would be perfect. However, it is sometimes impossible because of *market status*, or by [technical problem][technical-problem].
- periods: This represents how many iterations or process being done.

Let's do the setup first.

{% highlight python %}
P = init_price
S_inv = inversefunc(S)
{% endhighlight %}

And in iteration, we have,
{% highlight python %}
S_cur = [S(P), P]
D_cur = [D(P), P]
connectPoints(S_cur, D_cur)
# Supplier is adjusting Quantity, according to current demand
Q = S_adjusting_function(D(P))
P = S_inv(Q)    
S_next = [Q, P]
connectPoints(D_cur, S_next)
{% endhighlight %}

We now have *current* status of market as : *S_cur*, *D_cur*

If the economy is not in equilibrium, what would be the supplier's response?

According to our model, given *D(P)*, supplier would respond as supplying *S_adjusting_function(D(P))*.

Let's experiment few examples of adjusting function later on!

Anyway, by that adjustment, next periods' supply is determined. Here, *S_next*.

Next, we can define equilibrium condition as *abs(D(P) - S(P)) < ϵ*, which means quantity supplied and quantity demanded are almost identical. 

If we are near equilibrium, break. report.

{% highlight python %}
# if market is near equilibrium, break.
if(abs(D(P) - S(P)) < ϵ):
	print("Market is in equilibrium.\n",\
        "Iteration: ", i+1, "\n",\
        "-Supply side\n",\
        "P: ", P, "\n",\
        "Q: ", S(P), "\n", \
        "-Demand side\n",\
        "P: ", P, "\n",\
        "Q: ", D(P), "\n"\
       )
  break
{% endhighlight %}

else, just report.

{% highlight python %}
# if market was not able to reach equilibrium, report.
if((i == periods - 1) and (abs(D(P) - S(P)) >= ϵ)):
print("Economy wasn't able to reach equilibrium.\n",\
			"-Supply side\n",\
			"P: ", P, "\n",\
			"Q: ", S(P), "\n", \
			"-Demand side\n",\
			"P: ", P, "\n",\
			"Q: ", D(P), "\n", \
			)
{% endhighlight %}

### Experiments: 
Let's do some experiments. 
      
**Case 1**

$$ D: Q = 1 - P $$
$$ S: Q = P $$
$$ Adjusting function: Q_(n+1) = D(Q_n) * 0.9 $$
$$ P_0 = 0 $$

{% highlight python %}
D = lambda P: 1-P
S = lambda P: P
S_adjusting_function = lambda Q: 0.9* Q
init_price = 0
Q_max = 1
P_max = 1

plotMarket(D, S, Q_max, P_max)
cobwebProcess(D, S, S_adjusting_function, init_price, 0.01, 100)
plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

Result for case 1:
```
Market is in equilibrium.
 Iteration:  27 
 -Supply side
 P:  0.5012288227909136 
 Q:  0.5012288227909136 
 -Demand side
 P:  0.5012288227909136 
 Q:  0.49877117720908637
```
