Starting point of Problem Solving is to find all possible cases.

*DFS(Depth First Search)* and *BFS(Breadth First Search)* are good ways to do so.

# Idea
Suppose that we are trying to find a way out to maze.
To schemes can be summarized as follows:
- DFS: Go deep as far as I can. What if I got wrong? Go back to the recent point of your fork.
- BFS: Investigate every possible ways from your current point.

# Howto
When programming, I usally find following convetions.

## DFS
- check in
- destination?
- iterate
- can I go next?
- visit the point.
- check out

## BFS
- pop the queue
- destination?
- iterate
- can I go next?
- check in & enqueue

# Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(N), as our task is to traverse all N nodes.
- Space: O(logN) for DFS, as DFS only stores the single path, and O(N) for BFS as all nodes can be pushed to the queue.
