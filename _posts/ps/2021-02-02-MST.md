How can we design the most efficient network of nodes?

# Idea
Suppose that our task is to design the most efficient network of nodes.

Also, we have additional condition: 

If A B are connected & B C are connected, then A C are connected.

For my small example,

How would you handle this problem, and what were the reasons behind your logic?

# How To
## Smaller Things First
To minimize cost, it is very natural to consider from the lowest cost.

What should we do? Sorting.

## Checking Connection
We have another exception: What if A and B have already been connected?

In this case, we may not need to add this route, as A and B was set up at a lower cost.

Therefore, to implement this logic, it is necessary to track up the connections.

How to do that? What we need here is [Disjoint Set](https://dongminkim0220.github.io/posts/disjoint_set/) algorithm.

## Halting Condition
When should we stop then? 

Here is the fact: For Tree, we need n-1 edges.

So as counted edge has the number of n-1, algorithm stops.

# Complexity Analysis
Graph takes E edges, V vertices.
- Time: Sorting takes O(ElogE), which is O(ElogV) as $$E ~ V^2$$. For edges, we need to traverse E edges at worst. This takes O(ElogV). Overall, O(ElogV).
- Space: O(E) to store edges, O(V) for disjoint set
