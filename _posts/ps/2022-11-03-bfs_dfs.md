*DFS (Depth First Search)* and *BFS (Breadth First Search)*.

# Template Code (Python)
## DFS
```python
def dfs(graph, v, visited, dst):
  # 1. check in
  visited[v] = True
  print(v, end=" ")
  # 2. arrived?
  # 3. iterate
  for i in graph[v]:
    # 4. next
    if not visited[i]:
      # 5. visit
      dfs(graph, i, visited, dst)
      # 6. check out
```

## BFS
```python
def bfs(graph, src, visited, dst):
  queue = deque([src])
  visited[src] = True

  while queue:
    # 1. pop
    v = queue.popleft()
    print(v, end=" ")
    # 2. arrived?
    # 3. iterate
    for i in graph[v]:
      # 4. next
      if not visited[i]:
        # 5. visit, enqueue
        queue.append(i)
        visited[i] = True
```



# Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(N), as our task is to traverse all N nodes.
- Space: O(logN) for DFS, as DFS only stores the single path, and O(N) for BFS as all nodes can be pushed to the queue.
